        <h2 class="display-5 mt-5 text-center">History of Our Church</h2>
        <p>A body of believers was organized in Hookerton, March 20, 1830, as a “Free-Will Baptist Church of Christ.”  Its members, a group who were in Grimsley Free Will Baptist Church, Maury, NC, had as their first pastor Elder James Moore. It wouldn't be until the 1840s that the church would become a Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), loosing many of its members in the process. 
            The church group worshipped in the “red painted union meeting house” on the public square in Hookerton until the present church was built in 1860-1861.
        </p>
        <p>On January 1, 1870, subscriptions were begun for the belfry which was built that year. The belfry at Hookerton Christian Church is unique in that it is built on the ground rather than on the roof of the church.  
            The story goes, and has been published in “Cornet” magazine, that the carpenter’s sweetheart did not want him to work on the steep pitched roof for fear he would fall. To keep her happy, he built it on the ground.</p>
        <p>Starting in the 1940s, the church began to expand, adding a parsonage across the street. It was after this was built that the church and parsonage were dedicated, and several families presented the church with a communion table, pulpit, and chairs. 
          It was also at this time that the church went from being a white, wood-siding building to having its beautiful brick veneer. During the 1950s, work was started on the Education Building and Fellowship Hall above, with the work completed in 1964. Some years later, the connector between the Sanctuary and the Education Building was built, providing cover during weather.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 text-center">What We Believe</h2>
        <p>As Disciples, we follow the Word of God, rather than the doctrine of the church. Each Disciples church is given the freedom to interpret the Word of God as they see it, but it does not mean that we manipulate the Word to our own means. We strive to live by God's Word to the best of our abilities, and believe that He sent His Son, Jesus, to wash away our sins by dying on the cross.</p>
        <h4 class="text-center font-weight-normal">What to expect</h4>
        <p>All those who believe are welcome to join us in communion, in which we partake every Sunday during service. You do not need to partake to join us, but it is an open invitation.</p>
        <p>We are also a very casual church. As such, we invite you to come as you are and feel comfortable.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 text-center">About Our Pastor</h2>
        <p>After our last pastor stepped down, Allen Ham answered the calling to be our interim pastor. A few Sundays went by with him in the pulpit and we all felt a connection. He later answered the calling to take on our church as his own.</p>
        <p>Allen, a native of Eastern North Carolina, joined the Air Force after high school and served his country in the Vietnam war. After coming home, he married Glenna Wood and they raised two wonderful daughters through their 47-year marriage. Allen felt moved to answer God’s calling and graduated from Atlantic Christian College with a BA in Religion and Philosophy. 
            Afterwards, he helped start the gospel group Heaven Bound where he sang with, and acted as the manager of, the group until 1988. He returned to full-time farming and part-time evangelical work after coming off the road. 
            Allen has been a Chaplain at Walter B Jones Alcohol & Drug Rehab Center and is presently a Chaplain at Caswell Developmental Center in Kinston, where he is loved by the residents he serves.</p>
        <p>Allen’s family has grown to more than just his wife, two daughters and their husbands and children, to include us and all those whose lives he has touched with his kind message of the Lord.</p>
